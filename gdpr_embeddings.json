The controller shall seek the advice of the data protection officer, where designated, when carrying out a data protection impact assessment. A data protection impact assessment referred to in paragraph 1 shall in particular be required in the case of:a systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural persons which is based on automated processing, including profiling, and on which decisions are based that produce legal effects concerning the natural person or similarly significantly affect the natural person;processing on a large scale of special categories of data referred to inArticle 9(1), or of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to inArticle 10; ora systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale. a systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural persons which is based on automated processing, including profiling, and on which decisions are based that produce legal effects concerning the natural person or similarly significantly affect the natural person; processing on a large scale of special categories of data referred to inArticle 9(1), or of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to inArticle 10; or a systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale. 1The supervisory authority shall establish and make public a list of the kind of processing operations which are subject to the requirement for a data protection impact assessment pursuant to paragraph 1.2The supervisory authority shall communicate those lists to the Board referred to inArticle 68. 1The supervisory authority may also establish and make public a list of the kind of processing operations for which no data protection impact assessment is required.2The supervisory authority shall communicate those lists to the Board. Prior to the adoption of the lists referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5, the competent supervisory authority shall apply the consistency mechanism referred to inArticle 63where such lists involve processing activities which are related to the offering of goods or services to data subjects or to the monitoring of their behaviour in several Member States, or may substantially affect the free movement of personal data within the Union. The assessment shall contain at least:a systematic description of the envisaged processing operations and the purposes of the processing, including, where applicable, the legitimate interest pursued by the controller;an assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the processing operations in relation to the purposes;an assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in paragraph 1; andthe measures envisaged to address the risks, including safeguards, security measures and mechanisms to ensure the protection of personal data and to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation taking into account the rights and legitimate interests of data subjects and other persons concerned. a systematic description of the envisaged processing operations and the purposes of the processing, including, where applicable, the legitimate interest pursued by the controller; an assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the processing operations in relation to the purposes; an assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in paragraph 1; and the measures envisaged to address the risks, including safeguards, security measures and mechanisms to ensure the protection of personal data and to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation taking into account the rights and legitimate interests of data subjects and other persons concerned. Compliance with approved codes of conduct referred to inArticle 40by the relevant controllers or processors shall be taken into due account in assessing the impact of the processing operations performed by such controllers or processors, in particular for the purposes of a data protection impact assessment. Where appropriate, the controller shall seek the views of data subjects or their representatives on the intended processing, without prejudice to the protection of commercial or public interests or the security of processing operations.

Where necessary, the controller shall carry out a review to assess if processing is performed in accordance with the data protection impact assessment at least when there is a change of the risk represented by processing operations.",
